                I want some dark cyberpunk-noir-like stuff. My favorite movie is Blade Runner 2049. I also like Ghost in the shell (including anime), Nolan's batman series and other, Dune, Drive, Equilibrium, Oblivion, Alita, Ex Machina, Psychopass anime series, Upgrade. I like games like Cyberpunk, Prey 2017, Dishonored, Mass Effect series, System Shock. I listen to dark ambient, synthwave and retrowave cinematic music alongside with post-hardcore.
