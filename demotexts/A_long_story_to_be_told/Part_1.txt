The average number of characters per page in a typical fiction book can vary depending on several factors, such as the font size, line spacing, and page dimensions. However, a common estimation is around 300 to 500 characters per page.

Here's a rough breakdown:

    Assuming a standard font size (e.g., 12 pt) and line spacing (e.g., double-spaced) for a fiction book, a page typically contains:
        Approximately 25-30 lines per page
        Approximately 10-12 words per line
        Assuming an average word length of 5 characters
    Based on this estimation, a typical page would contain:
        25 lines × 10 words per line × 5 characters per word = 1,250 characters per page
    However, since fiction books often use smaller fonts (e.g., 11 pt) and tighter line spacing (e.g., 1.5 or single-spaced), a more conservative estimate would be:
        30 lines × 12 words per line × 5 characters per word = 1,800 characters per page

Therefore, a reasonable estimate for the average character count per page in a typical fiction book would be around 1,500 characters.

To estimate the virtual "page count" for a text file based on its size, you can divide the total number of characters in the file by the estimated characters per page. For example, if your text file has 150,000 characters, and you assume 1,500 characters per page, the estimated virtual "page count" would be:

150,000 characters ÷ 1,500 characters per page = 100 pages

Keep in mind that this is a rough estimation, and the actual page count may vary depending on the specific formatting and layout of the book or text file.

At first, you said it's about 300-500 characters, then calculated it to be 1500. What is correct?

You're right, my initial estimate of 300-500 characters per page was too low. The calculation I provided later, estimating around 1,500 characters per page for a typical fiction book, is more accurate.

To clarify:

The reasonable estimate for the average character count per page in a typical fiction book is around 1,500 characters.

My initial 300-500 characters per page estimate was an underestimation. Thank you for catching that inconsistency. The 1,500 characters per page figure from the calculation is the correct estimate you should use when trying to estimate virtual "page count" from the size of a text file, for a typical fiction book format.
